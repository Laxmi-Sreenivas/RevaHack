# RevaHack2022

Project Name: Swasthya

Tagline: Empowering People to Improve Their Lives

The problem it solves: Consider the scenario where Surya Vamsi recently saw a doctor but is unhappy with the outcome and seeks a second opinion.
                       Surya could not have all the prior reports when the second doctor asks about his medical history, making it challenging for 
                       all parties.
                       Surya may schedule appointments, check medical records, obtain reports, and share them with this app.
